# QuickSpot-Radio-2
OS X keyboard controller for Spotify premium

Older app I built and used for spotify, before Spotify acquired the echonest music platform.  It was a menubar app with global keyboard commands. It included growl.app notifications with cover art when songs switched.

The app used echonest to create better playlists based on their algorithms because at the time spotify's radio sucked.
I havent built the app in a year or 2, so chances are it doesnt work with spotify or echonest APIs anymore.  Objective-c code should be working for the most part though.
