# QuickSpot-Radio-2
OS X keyboard controller for Spotify premium

Older app I built and used for spotify, before Spotify acquired the echonest music platform.  It was a menubar app with gloabl keyboard commands.

The app used echonest to create better playlist based on their algorithms because at the time spotifys radio sucked.
I havent built the app in a year or 2, so chances are it doesnt work with spotify or echonest APIs anymore.  Objective-c code should be working for the most part though.
